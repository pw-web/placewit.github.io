They conducted mock interviews, which really helped me a lot in my preparation for the interviews, which I consider one of the many reasons for my growth. I will always be grateful to Placewit for how it impacted my life and helped me to get placed at Amazon. Placewit truly came as a blessing in my life.",

Before I started here, I used to lack confidence and had various fears due to lack of experience. Over the months, I've come to experience a lot and learned a lot, and I can now say I can behave in a much more confident manner when it comes to sitting for any interview. So thank you to all the mentors who have been a great help along the way.",

The faculty is excellent. I have learnt a lot from Rishabh sir, special thanks to him. The way he taught us was amazing. In conclusion, I would say that I would recommend my juniors to join this, if anyone finds difficulty in coding.",

Right from the start, they focused on the foundation of the student, they helped to visualize the concepts and how one can apply them in their problem solving approach. The instructors are well versed in their work, they explained each doubt in detail. I would recommend everyone to take this course if they are looking for guidance from learning basics to getting chance to crack top notch software engineering companies."

P.S: Placewit mentors, you guys showed a good amount of patience with me. Keep trying with students like me and make them feel capable."

When I joined Placewit I was in situation where it took lot of time to come up with brute force logic and after attending its classroom program, I'm getting optimum approach very quickly in CP. I learned different concepts in WebDev and did some interesting projects. I also learned different CS topics like OS, DBMS etc. One to one mentorship at Placewit was very helpful in clearing doubts, no matter whether it was regarding subjects, company or how to crack interviews. Weekly tests and frequent mock interviews helped me in building confidence and enhancing communication skills. I would like to thank Aman, Tejas, Ritik, Rishab and Gagan sir. Thank you Placewit."
