    "review": "I think for me, joining Placewit was the best decision I had taken last year. I would like to thank the whole team to give me this opportunity. Honestly, I had an awesome experience throughout the year. Last year, I knew only C++ language and nothing else. Now, I have improved a lot and was able to get my dream placement. The faculty is excellent. I have learnt a lot from Rishabh sir, special thanks to him. The way he taught us was amazing. In conclusion, I would say that I would recommend my juniors to join this, if anyone finds difficulty in coding.",

    "review": "Been training with Placewit since January, and it has been a great learning experience. Before I started here, I used to lack confidence and had various fears due to lack of experience. Over the months, I've come to experience a lot and learned a lot, and I can now say I can behave in a much more confident manner when it comes to sitting for any interview. So thank you to all the mentors who have been a great help along the way.",
